   meta.js — what this mockup is, in one place.

   Two versions, and they are not the same thing:

     MOCKUP_VERSION  this build of the mockup. It moves when the screens move —
                     a review round applied, a flow reordered — and it is what
                     anyone looking at the app or holding a printout of it is
                     talking about when they say "which version is this".
     SPEC_VERSION    the requirement set the mockup is built against. It moves
                     when the SPECIFICATION does, which is somebody else's
                     document and somebody else's numbering. Saying v1.5 here
                     would claim a document that does not exist.

   The bar prints both, so a comment about a screen and a comment about a
   requirement can be told apart six weeks from now.

   NOTHING IS IMPORTED HERE ON PURPOSE. app/version.js is rewritten wholesale at
   deploy time and cannot hold anything hand-written; harness.js is full of DOM.
   A module with no dependencies can be read by the browser and by a Node tool
   alike, which is how tools/screendeck.mjs stamps the deck with the same
   version the app is showing.
